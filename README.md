This is an attempt to produce an expressive upper layer meant to distribute and display community metrics and be easily installable atop a Django framework for quick and 'easy' installation on a community-by-community basis.

... just as an update note; still running through a geodjango experiment to see if it is a desirable presentation framework for this kind of thing; I have certain ideas in mind that could be done more lightly and with more visual flexibility through, say, node.js and a full javascript stack ... but would require significantly more work to see the first working draft of, vs. geodjango.  Juggling these concerns in what time I have to devote to this.
